# Speaker Notes Guidelines for Presentation Slides

## Core Principle
Speaker notes should support natural presentation flow—as if you're speaking to an audience while advancing through slides. The content should be split roughly 90% on slides, 100% in speaker notes (full coverage but mostly visible).

## Structure & Content

### 1. Echo the Slide Content
- Repeat key headings and bullet points from the slide exactly in the speaker notes
- This ensures the notes align with what the audience sees
- Don't create separate explanations that diverge from the slide structure

### 2. Add Minimal Explanations (1-2 sentences max per point)
- Only add explanations AFTER slide content that needs elaboration
- Keep expansions brief and conversational
- Imagine you're naturally elaborating on what you just read from the slide

### 3. Don't Explain Self-Evident Content
- Skip explanations for questions that are immediately answered on the slide
- Don't explain material that appears in the next animation/section
- Let the slide content speak for itself when appropriate

### 4. Add Click Indicators
- Use `[→ Click for...]` to mark where the presenter should advance to the next animation
- Place indicators where `. . .` (incremental reveals) appear on the slide
- Only mark actual slide transitions, not internal elaborations
- Example: `[→ Click to reveal approach]`

### 5. Match Slide Animation Structure
- Align speaker notes with the actual `. . .` dividers on the slide
- Don't create click points where none exist on the slide
- Follow the incremental reveal pattern exactly

### 6. Write for Natural Speech
- Use conversational language ("we're going to...", "let me explain...")
- Write as if speaking to an audience, not writing a textbook
- Avoid academic or overly formal tone
- Flow from one thought to the next naturally

### 7. Never Invent Content
- Don't add "key insights," "warnings," or conceptual sections that aren't on the slide
- Stay true to what the slide actually contains
- If something needs explaining, put it on the slide, not just in notes

## Workflow Example
1. **Read the slide structure** (headings, bullets, equations, animations)
2. **Identify where `. . .` animations occur** (these get click indicators)
3. **Write the script mirroring the slide** (repeat what's shown)
4. **Add 1-2 sentence explanations only** where helpful for elaboration
5. **Insert `[→ Click...]` markers** at actual animation points
6. **Review**: Does it sound like natural speaking? Does it match the slide exactly?

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't explain questions that are answered on the same slide
- ❌ Don't create separate scripts disconnected from slide content
- ❌ Don't add lengthy additional explanations
- ❌ Don't invent "key insights" or content not on the slide
- ❌ Don't add click indicators where slide animations don't exist
- ❌ Don't use overly technical or academic language

## Key Principle
The speaker notes guide presentation flow without duplicating content that's already visible, while providing just enough support for natural, confident delivery.
